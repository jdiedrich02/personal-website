        <p>
            Hi, I'm Jake! I am a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in programming languages and frameworks such as JavaScipt, Angular, TypeScript, HTML/CSS and more!
            I am currently a student in my 4th year working towards a bachelor's degree in computer science at Carleton University. I specialize in front-end development and am constantly 
            driven by a thirst for knowledge and innovation to create clean and realiable user interfaces.

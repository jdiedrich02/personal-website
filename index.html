                        Hi, I'm Jake! I am a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in programming languages and frameworks such as JavaScipt, Angular, TypeScript, HTML/CSS and more!
                        I am currently a student in my 4th year working towards a bachelor's degree in computer science at Carleton University. I specialize in front-end development and am constantly 
                        driven by a thirst for knowledge and innovation to create clean and realiable user interfaces.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The one thing I love about computer science is the broadness of the industry. There's always something new to learn, and I find that super exciting. I love to dive into new 
                        programming languages and frameworks! It's like discovering a new world each time I pick something new up! Creating something from scratch and learning new skills while doing
                        so is what drives my passion for this industry!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I am also super into space and the cosmos! Ever since I watched the movie Interstellar when I was younger, I've been hooked. I like looking into space and just thinking of our 
                        place in the universe! I am also into Astrophotography, and have a few telescopes that I use to go out and take pictures! Check out my <a href="./astro.html">Astrophotography</a>
                        page if you want to see some photos I have taken! My favourite photos to take are of star clusters and galaxies (there are a few on the page!)
